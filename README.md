Convertium is a simple python script which recursively looks for video files in configured directories, then automatically reformats them in a style to minimize transcoding, by maximizing compatibility with as many devices as possible. Files will be automatically reformatted to the following file format:
```bash
fps = 30
container = .mp4
video codec = h264
audio codec = mp3
resolution = 1920x1080
```

These options, along with many others are configurable in [`config/general.toml`](config/general.toml).

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JosiahBull/convertium/
cd convertuim
# add volumes for all content you want to scan, along with other relevant options
nano docker-compose.yml
# tell program to scan those volumes
nano config/general.toml
# begin scanning
docker-compose up -d
```
